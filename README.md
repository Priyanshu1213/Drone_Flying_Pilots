# Pilot Mapping and Filtering Application

This is a web application built using React and Node.js (with Express and MongoDB) for mapping drone pilots. 
The app displays drone pilots on an interactive map, provides filters based on location and range, and allows the admin to manage pilot data via their current location or manually entered coordinates.

## Features

- Interactive map displaying pilot locations (React Leaflet integration)
- Admin can filter pilots based on distance from their current location or a manually entered location
- Toggle between using current location or manually entered coordinates for pilot searches
- Responsive and modern UI with 3D CSS effects
- Real-time pilot data fetching from the backend API

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Leaflet, CSS (3D effects)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Mapping Library:** React Leaflet

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version >= 14.x)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based setup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
 -  git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu1213/Drone_Flying_Pilots.git
   

2. Install dependencies:
   
    - **npm install**

3. Start the backend server:

    - **cd backend**
    - **npm start**

4. Start the frontend React application:

    - **cd frontend**
    - **npm start**

### Usage

Admin can toggle between current location and manually entered coordinates to filter pilots.
The map updates dynamically based on admin location or entered coordinates.
Pilots can be filtered by their distance from the admin's location.
